Student Exam Performance Prediction -Regression Problem Statement

The "Student Exam Performance Prediction" project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts student performance based on various factors 
such as Gender, Parental Education and other relevant variables. The goal is  identifying students ,
who may be at risk of failing or performing poorly in exams, so that appropriate interventions can be taken to improve their academic outcomes.

The project involves collecting and cleaning data from multiple sources, Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the patterns and relationships between variables, and to identify any data quality issues. 
The data is then pre-processed and transformed to prepare it for use in machine learning algorithms.


Several machine learning models are developed and evaluated, including regression, decision trees, and Random Forest,Linear Regreesion,Ada Boost,XG Boost,Cat boost to determine which algorithm produces the most accurate and reliable predictions. 
The best-performing model is selected and fine-tuned to optimize its performance.

A Flask application is built to take inputs from teachers or administrators, such as a student's Read and Write scores, and other relevant information. The application combines these inputs with the pre-processed data from the machine learning model to predict the student's performance on future exams.
